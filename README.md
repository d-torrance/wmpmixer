wmpmixer
========

**wmpmixer** (or "wimpy mixer", as I affectionately call it) is a
[PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/)
mixer and [Window Maker](https://www.windowmaker.org/)
[dockapp](https://www.dockapps.net/).

Its look is nearly identical to
[wmmixer](https://www.dockapps.net/wmmixer), but it was completely
rewritten from scratch to use Window Maker's WINGs widget library.
